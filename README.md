# FlappyBird

This repository contains source code of the Flappy Bird game.

Flappy Bird is a game developed by Dong Nguyen that went viral in 2013, utilizing a very simple but effective gameplay mechanic of avoiding pipes indefinitely by just tapping the screen or using space key making the player's bird avatar flap its wings and move upwards slightly.

I have developed this game using LOVE2D gaming framework (version 0.10.2) with Lua as the scripting language.

For running this game you will need to install LOVE2D on your system.

You will also need to setup Lua in your system.

For Visual Studio Code, install following extensions:

> vscode-lua

Lua Debug
