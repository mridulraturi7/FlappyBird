# FlappyBird

This repository contains source code of the Flappy Bird game.

It is a game developed by Dong Nguyen that went viral in 2013, utilizing a very simple but effective gameplay mechanic of avoiding pipes indefinitely by just tapping the screen or using space key making the player's bird avatar flap its wings and move upwards slightly.
